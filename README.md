üé® Color Picker App
Welcome to the Color Picker App! This simple React app allows you to choose colors visually using a color picker input and see your selected color displayed dynamically. Whether you're experimenting with colors for design, development, or just for fun, this tool provides an interactive and engaging way to explore colors!

üåü Features
Real-Time Color Selection: As you pick a color from the color input, the background and label update instantly to reflect your choice.
Modern UI: Styled with a clean and simple design, including a gradient background, shadow effects, and smooth transitions.
Interactive Elements: Hover effects and animations make for a polished user experience.
üñ•Ô∏è Demo
The app consists of:

A Color Picker (input of type color) where you can select any color.
A Display Box that shows the selected color as a circle with a text label indicating the color‚Äôs name or hex value.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
The app is powered by React with a simple component structure:

State Management: useState is used to manage the color selected by the user.
Color Picker Input: The color input allows users to pick any color, and the onChange event updates the displayed color in real time.
Dynamic Styling: The selected color is used as the background color of a circular display box to give users immediate visual feedback.

Feel free to customize the colors, fonts, and layout in the App.css file to match your personal style or project requirements!
